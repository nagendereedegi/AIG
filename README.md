I  just completed AIG's Shields Up: Cybersecurity on Forage. In the simulation I:
Completed a cybersecurity threat analysis simulation for the Cyber Defense Unit, staying updated on CISA publications.
Researched and understood reported vulnerabilities, showcasing analytical skills in cybersecurity.
Drafted a clear and concise email to guide teams on vulnerability remediation.
Utilized Python skills to write a script for ethical hacking, avoiding ransom payments by bruteforcing decryption keys.
